# This file defines all users that will be added to the submitty vagrant machine. It will add the users regardless of
# whether or not that user is in any course on the vagrant machine. Each user is defined via global definitions which
# will be used unless you specify a particular value for a setting for a particular course (see below). This allows for
# most users to be added quickly (as they'll be the same across courses) while some users only being in certain courses
# or in certain ways. A good primer on YAML syntax can be found at http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html.
#
# The format for each entry is (anything marked optional can be omitted from any entry):
#   user_id: string representing the id for the user both in the database as well as linux
#
#   user_firstname: string for the user's first name
#
#   user_preferred_firstname: [optional] name to display for user instead of their legal first name
#         If this is omitted, then it will go into the database as NULL
#
#   user_lastname: string to display as the user's last name
#
#   user_email: [optional] string for the user's email.
#         If this is omitted, then it will go into the database as <user_id>@example.com
#
#   user_group: [optional] integer for what group user should be. This is a number between 0-4 inclusively.
#         If omitted, this will default to the integer 4.
#
#   unix_groups: [optional] when creating the user, only explicitly put them into these unix groups
#         By default, any user that is an instructor or higher for any course is put into the "course_builders".
#         Then, they will be added to the following groups by their group level for a given course:
#           instructors and above:
#             <course_id>
#             <course_id>_archive
#           TAs and above:
#             <course_id>_tas_www
#
#   registration_section: [optional] registration section to place the user into. Defaults to NULL.
#
#   rotating_section: [optional] rotating section to place the user into. Defaults to NULL.
#
#   courses: This is a either a list of strings of courses to add the user to or a list of dictionaries that contain
#         course specific settings for this user (the dictionary can be empty though if you just want the course and
#         to use the "global" settings for the user. If this is defined, the user will not be added to any course not
#         included in this list. An example of the basic usage is:
#
#         courses:
#           - csci1100
#           - csci1200
#
#         where the user will only be added to the csci1100 and csci1200 courses using the settings defined above.
#         A more complex usage would be:
#
#         courses:
#           csci1100:
#             user_group: 4
#             registration_section: 1
#           csci1200:
#             user_group: 1
#
#         where now the user is added to the two courses as before, but their in different groups in the courses (and
#         different unix groups), as well as having a registration_section in the first course that overrides the
#         global setting.
#
#   sudo: [optional] boolean on whether to give user sudo access. Defaults to False.
#
# If you need help coming up with a name for some fake user: http://random-name-generator.info/ and then just make the
# user_id be first five letters of last name + first letter of first name.

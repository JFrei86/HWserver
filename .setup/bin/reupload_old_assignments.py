# ARGUMENTS
# 1) The path to the top level of the old assignment's directory tree. This folder's subdirectories should mirror 
#    a /var/local/submitty/courses/<semester>/<course>/submissions/<assignment_name> folder.
# 2) The semester of the course to which the old assignments will be uploaded.
# 3) The name of the course to which the old assignments will be uploaded.
# 4) The name of the current assignment to which the old assignments will be uploaded
# 5) The optional argument --grade, which causes the uploaded assignments to be added to the grading queue.

#NOTE: variables beginning with ARCHIVED_ are populated using the homework assignment being copied.
#Varialbes beginning with CURRENT_ are populated using the destination/current semester's directories.

## Google Summer of Code 2018
General note to those interested in Google Summer of Code 2018. We will not be adding folks to the
Submitty organization or assigning issues through GitHub to interested applicants until students
are accepted into the program. We are in the process of setting up a separate communication channel
for the Google Summer of Code since the current Slack channel requires an RPI email address to join.

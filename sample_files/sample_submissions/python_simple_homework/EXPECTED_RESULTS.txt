EXPECTED RESULTS 
AUTOMATED GRADING


NOTE: This assignment configuration does not award points for
correctness, but does mark (with red & yellow highlighting) the
differences between the output produced by the student's code and the
expected output.


part1.py
   Produces the full credit correct solution.


part1_buggy.py
   This version contains an extra character ('vs.' instead of 'vs'
   which will be highlighted as incorrect).


part1_buggy2.py 
   This version prints the output as floating point and thus the
   untruncated decimal output is highlighted as incorrect.


syntax_error.py
   This version has a syntax error part way through execution and the
   undefined error message should be displayed to the user.


infinite_loop_too_much_output.py
   This version has an infinite loop with print output inside the
   loop, the program will be terminated because of excessive output
   and a meaningful message presented to the user.


infinite_loop_time_cutoff.py
   This version has an infinite loop (with no output) and the program
   should be terminated after a reasonable (instructor customizable)
   amount of time.

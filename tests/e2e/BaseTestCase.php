 * minimum override the class variables $user_id, $password, and $test_url for that particular test case. If a custom
 * setUp or tearDown routine is defined within the child class, it should also still call the parent class's function
 * so as to ensure that logging in and out still happens (unless that's not necessary for a particular test)

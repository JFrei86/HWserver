This script will take backup dumps of each individual Submitty course
database.  This should be set up by a sysadmin to be run on the Submitty
server as a cron job by root.  Recommend that this is run nightly.

The semester code can be specified as a command line argument.  This allows
database dumps of previous semesters or of unique semester codes.  If no
command line arguments are given, the semester code will be determined by
the current month and year.  e.g. April 2018 would correspond to the
Spring 2018 semester code "s18".

WARNING: Backup data contains sensitive information protected by FERPA, and
as such should have very strict access permissions.

Change values under CONFIGURATION to match access properties of your
university's Submitty database and file system.  Change EXPIRATION to match
how many days of dumps to keep.  Older dumps are automatically deleted.
